        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It sounds ridiculous to create a pizza out of zucchini, but don't knock this dish before you try it! Crisp zucchini is combined with eggs, meat, and cheese to produce a hearty meal that pleases both veggie and meat lovers!</p>
        
        <p>This meal takes only 20 minutes to an hour to make and serves 8 people with the base recipe. The zucchini has the role of being the base of the dish, so no bread required!</p>
