        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Although the dish is called Garlic Beef Enchiladas, it resembles a casserole more than a classical Mexicn food. Garlic and other seasonings are used to flavor the beef, while cheese, tortillas, and spices are used to hold the ingredients together.</p>

        <p>This meal takes 30 minutes to an hour to make and serves 5 people with just the base recipe. Corn tortillas or flour tortillas can be used to make the dish. Additional toppings can include jalepeno peppers, avocado, and halved grape tomatoes.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prehead oven to 350 degrees. In a large skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, 6-8 minutes, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour and seasonings. Add tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 minute or until tender. Stir in flour until blended; gradually whisk in broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce and seasonings; heat through.</li>
            <li>Pour 1-1/2 cups sauce into an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish. Place about 1/4 cup beef mixture off center on each tortilla; top with 1-2 tablespoons cheese. Roll up and place over sauce, seam side down. Top with remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake, covered, until heated through, 30-35 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, until cheese is melted, 10-15 minutes longer. Serve with toppings as desired.</li>
        </ol>
